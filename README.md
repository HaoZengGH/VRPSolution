# Vehicle Routing Problem

This project provides a solution to the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). Specifically, our application tries to find the most efficient assignment of Loads to Drivers, given a set of constraints such as maximum working time for drivers, cost considerations, and others, ensuring that the services are performed at the lowest possible cost.
